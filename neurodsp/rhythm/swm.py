    Notes
    -----
    - The `win_len` parameter should be chosen to be about the size of the motif of interest.
      The larger this window size, the more likely the pattern to reflect slower patterns.
    - The `win_spacing` parameter also determines the number of windows that are used.
    - If looking at high frequency activity, you may want to apply a highpass filter,
      so that the algorithm does not converge on a low frequency motif.
    - This implementation is a minimal version, as compared to the original implementation
      in [2], which has more available options.
    - This version may also be much slower than the original, as this implementation does not
      currently include the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to calculate distances.
